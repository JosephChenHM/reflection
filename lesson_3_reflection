When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    to share my project with someone or working in different device

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    if i am working with something,i don't wanna pull any changes that might potential damage my work.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks: Clone project from auther git repo and make some change and traceable
    Clone: Download it to your computer to continue you work
    Branches: Make a new feature or make a new version of project. I can merge all branch later on for final result.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    you can cowork with many people and getting new version

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Have to discuss to your cowork first and make agreement to adopt the change.
    Using Git is sure easier than discuss to coworker

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    have some advice/some idea on project, i'll start a new branch and add some commit.
    Using pull request to interact with other coworker and review my change.
    Finally merge it to master to make project more great.
