How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    easiy find out typo or last change

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    we can learning from past

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    auto saving is great,but sometimes i just want to slightly change parameter that will cause lots of versions

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    multiple saving file is for programing that you have to creat relative file with one program,however Google Docs doesn't have to.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    using log to see when commit and using diff to see different log of commit history

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    i can easily go back to last workable version

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    refine my program and share with other

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

	i can easy view changes that find out true bug is.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

	cause function code are highly relative,one logical change might change serival file. On the other hand,Docs doesn't.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

	i can easy checkout older version and find bug. It give me more confident to make some changes.
